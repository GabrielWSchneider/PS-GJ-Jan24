  LMB to Shout

When the footsteps are far, shout, which alerts the attendant
Stop shouting before the attendant comes
Don't get kicked out!
Listen for the footsteps

Be as disruptive as possible before the museum closes.


Possible "It Spreads" expansion

1) Glass coverings shatter and shards vibrate over the tile each time you scream.
2) On other levels some of the museum regulars try to scream too, possibly disrupting your play until they are quickly disappeared by museum staff
2.2) troublemakers become skeletal exhibits until the museum is full and the game ends
3) You gain notoriety, making your melodious journey more difficult (as seen on the news and on bulletin boards at the front desk)
