Behold, Museum Mania! This is our team's entry into the Jamuary 2024 Pirate Software Game Jam!

The "Sprites" folder contains both the original Aseprite project for each sprite, as well as the exported spritesheets. All of these are custom-made, and therefore we are able to use them freely in commercial products (or this game jam).

The "SFX" and "Placeholder Scenes" folders contain temp assets used to get the prototype working. We don't have a commercial license for these, so they will need to be replaced in the final version.

The "Pirate Software Game Jamuary 2024" folder contains information provided by the host of the game jam, Pirate Software. None of these files belong to us.

We are missing:
  - A coherent Game Design Document.
    - There is a version of this floating around somewhere in our Discord messages. We should add it!
